## All About Me

I'm <kbd>Nik L.</kbd>, a marketing enthusiast who's also got a thing for coding. What's my deal? Well, I like to mix marketing with a bit of technical know-how. If you're on the hunt for someone who can handle both marketing and coding, you've found your guy.

## What I'm Up To

- I'm all about making marketing ideas come to life with tech. üíª
- My special sauce? I create interactive tools that fit right into marketing campaigns. üí°
- Right now, I'm honing my coding skills with React, CSS, HTML, JS, Next, and Node. It's fun, tbh! üå±
- Open to collaborations in notifications, communication APIs, and anything interactive marketing-related. üíûÔ∏è
